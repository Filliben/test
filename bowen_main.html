 1. <mark>Question</mark>   : 1. What are the most important factors affecting dental polysac adhesion?
                    Deliverable: Ranked list of 3 factors (and interactions)
                 2. What factor settings yield the highest adhesive strength?
                    Deliverable: Best settings for each of the 3 factors

 2. <mark>Design</mark>     : <a href = "2to3.html">2**3 full factorial (k=3 factors,n=8 observations)</a>
                    1. Response Y = Adhesive Strength
                    2. Factor  X1 = Agent       (2 levels:  aa and  bb)
                    3. Factor  X2 = Cleanser    (2 levels:  cc and  dd)
                    4. Factor  X3 = Mordant     (2 levels:  ee and ff)

 5. <mark>Conclusions</mark>:
    1. The data ranges from 90 to 374, with a mean adhesive strength of 184.875.
    2. There is 1 important factor: X2 (cleanser) with an effect of 154.3 (= 83.43%);
       this is statistically significant (p < .05).	   
       The least important (main) factor is X3 (mordant) with an effect of 31.25 (= 16.90%)  
    3. Interactions: The second most important factor is an X1X2 (agent x cleaner) interaction with 
	   an effect of 66.75 (= 36.11%); this interaction is of interest, but not statistically significant.
    4. The best setting (yielding a response of Y = 374) is (X1,X2,X3) = (+ + +),
       that is,(agent = bb, cleanser = dd, mordant = ff)
    5. The best direction for potential future adhesive strength improvement would be by 
       increasing both X2 (cleanser) and X1 (mordant).
